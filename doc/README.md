This directory should contain the documentation for your software. For the
official template of a manual provided by the Computational Infrastructure for
Geodynamics see here:
https://github.com/geodynamics/best_practices/tree/master/software_manual_template

Keep in mind that your code should ideally also use an in-source documentation
system like doxygen or autodoc. We recommend writing your manual in LaTeX (like
the template linked above), Markdown, or reStructuredText.
