This directory should contain the documentation for your software. For the
official manual template in tex provided by the Computational Infrastructure for
Geodynamics, see:
https://github.com/geodynamics/best_practices/tree/master/software_manual_template

To generate html documentation using sphinx, see the directory /sphinx_template. 
Navigate to sphinx_template/docs/_build/html and double click on index.html to access
instructions on how to use the template and to view the example.

Keep in mind that your code should ideally also use an in-source documentation
system like doxygen or autodoc. We recommend writing your manual in LaTeX (like
the template linked above), Markdown, or reStructuredText.
