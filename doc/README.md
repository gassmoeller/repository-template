This directory should contain the documentation for your software.

For the official Sphinx documentation template see https://software-template.readthedocs.io,
which also includes information on how to build the documentation locally
in the `sphinx_template/` directory.
After building the documentation you can navigate to `sphinx_template/_build/html`
and open `index.html` to view the example offline.
For an alternative manual template written in LaTex see the `latex_template/` directory.

Keep in mind that your code should ideally also use an in-source documentation
system like doxygen or autodoc. We recommend writing your manual in LaTeX (like
the LaTex template), Markdown (like the Sphinx template), or reStructuredText.
