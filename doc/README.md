This directory should contain the documentation for your software. For the
official manual template in LaTex, see:
https://github.com/geodynamics/best_practices/tree/master/software_manual_template

For the official Sphinx documentation template see https://software-template.readthedocs.io,
which also includes information on how to build the documentation locally
in the /sphinx_template directory.
After building the documentation you can navigate to sphinx_template/_build/html
and double click on index.html to view the example offline.

Keep in mind that your code should ideally also use an in-source documentation
system like doxygen or autodoc. We recommend writing your manual in LaTeX (like
the template linked above), Markdown, or reStructuredText.
