# Contributing to SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE
SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating! 

## Getting started with git and GitHub
If you are new to using git or the GitHub platform you should start by taking one of the many freely available git tutorials (for an excellent medium depth tutorial see: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Additionally, GitHub provides a helpful
guide on the process of managing a github project: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/.

## Asking and answering questions about SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE
For questions about SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE on all levels, please use the 
[SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE forum](https://community.geodynamics.org/). 

## Bug reports
It is a great help to the community if you report any bugs that you
may find. We keep track of all open issues related to SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE
[here](https://github.com/geodynamics/software_template/issues). 

Please follow these simple instructions before opening a new bug report:

- Do a quick search in the list of open and closed issues for a duplicate of
  your issue.
- If you did not find an answer, open a new
  [issue](https://github.com/geodynamics/software_template/issues/new) and explain your
  problem in as much detail as possible.
- Attach as much as possible of the following information to your issue:
  - a minimal setup that reproduces the issue,
  - the model output that was created during the model run,
  - the error message you saw on your screen,
  - any information that helps us understand why you think this is a bug, and
    how to reproduce it.

## Making SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE better
SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE is a community project, and we are encouraging all kinds of
contributions. 

Describe the kind of contributions you are looking for.

If you consider making a larger contribution to the core functionality, please
open a new [issue](https://github.com/geodynamics/software_template/issues/new)
first, to discuss your idea with one of the maintainers. This allows us to give
you early feedback and prevents you from spending much time on a project that
might already be planned, or that conflicts with other plans.

To make a change to SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE you should:
- Create a
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) (through GitHub) of
the code base.
- Create a separate
[branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (sometimes called a
feature branch) on which you do your modifications.
- You can propose that your branch be merged into the SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE
code by opening a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
This will give others a chance to review your code. 

We follow the philosophy that no pull request (independent of the author) is
merged without a review from one other member of the community, and approval of
one of the maintainers. This applies to maintainers as well as to first-time
contributors. We know that a review can be a daunting process, but pledge to
keep all comments friendly and supportive. We are as
interested in making SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE better as you are!

While this seems very formal, keeping all of the code review in one place makes
it easier to coordinate changes to the code (and there are usually several
people making changes to the code at once). Please do not hesitate to ask
questions about the workflow on the forum if you are not sure what to do.

If you follow a set of formal coding conventions or code formatting software
describe it here. Also describe how new contributors can set up their machine
to follow these coding conventions.

If you are new to the project then we will work with you to ensure your
contributions are formatted with this style, so please do not think of it as a
road block if you would like to contribute some code.

## Acknowledgment of contributions
While we are grateful for every contribution, there are also several official
ways how your contribution will be acknowledged by the SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE community:
- Every commit that was merged into the SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE repository will make you part of
  the growing group of SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE
  [contributors](https://github.com/geodynamics/software_template/graphs/contributors).
- Mention any other kind of attribution your project will provide (e.g. newsletters, release papers, manual authorship).
- Regularly, the Principal Developers of SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE come together and discuss based
  on the contributions of the last years who should be invited to join the
  group of Principal Developers. Criteria that *Principal Developers* should
  match are:

  - A profound understanding of SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE's structure and vision,
  - A proven willingness to further the project's goals and help other users,
  - Significant contributions to SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE (not necessarily only source code,
    also mailing list advice, documentation, benchmarks, tutorials),
  - Regular and active contributions to SOFTWARE_TEMPLATE for more than one year,
    not restricted to user meetings.

  The group of current Principal Developers is listed in the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)
  file in the main repository.

will retain copyright on your contributions, all changes to the code
